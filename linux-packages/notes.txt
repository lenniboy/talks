- Scala webservice
  Long compilation times
  We knew we wanted DevOps but we also knew that it was complicated

- Previous 2 employers/customers used native packaging: Debian/RPM
  Very good solution but complicated and time-consuming
  Particularly maintaing a package repository is complicated and has brought
  seasoned dev-ops close to tears.
  dpkg-scanpackages

  So since we are an Amazon shop we don't want to build, maintain, monitor
  yet another server so we want to host on S3 since it has practically
  unlimited disk space.

  So far: build slaves build debs, scp to mirror of package repository,
  adds it to its repository and rebuilds the entire repository. Unoptimised
  took about 10-15 minutes. Then upload to S3 with s3cmd which is also
  calculating hashes again.

  deb-s3: Ruby gem for uploading deb files to an S3 bucket. If necessary 
  creates repository layout. From deb to repository ready to download in 
  < 1 minute

- Demo start with an empty bucket, have Debian package, upload to S3
- Install package on prepared Vagrant box

- Upstart
  Has been around for quite a while but I have used in this project for the
  first time.
